# Super store
In this activity, I create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

**Preview**

**Command List**

**node bamazonCustomer.js**

   The app should then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

**node bamazonManager.js**

 Running this application will:

  * List a set of menu options:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

**node bamazonSupervisor.js**

Running this application will list a set of menu options:

   * View Product Sales by Department
   
   * Create New Department
